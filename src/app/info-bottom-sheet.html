    This tool is used to calculate required margin for your trades with adequate RR (Risk-Reward). To use the tool you have to know, how much money you are ready to lose in case of reaching stop loss. This depends on your Risk Management.
</p>
<p>
    Let's say your trade RR is 1:3. It means that potential profit is 3 times bigger than potential loss. In "Risk" field you can specify the potential loss - whether in USD or Percentages of your Deposit Balance. Let's say you are ready to lose 1% of your deposit balance. If the trade is successful your profit is going to be +3% to the deposit balance

    This tool makes all the calculations for you - you just have to enter all the required data.

    Also keep in mind that the calculator displays values WITHOUT considering fee rates of your trading platform. So the potiential profit calculated by this tool may be a little different than the actual profit.
